# Definition and Purpose of Bonds

### **Definition and purpose of bonds:** <a href="#_knmj7rxdi4qj" id="_knmj7rxdi4qj"></a>

* Covalent bond: Covalent bonding is the **sharing** of valence electrons between atoms to achieve the stable electronic configuration of a noble gas which constitutes fully filled valence shells. (Covalent bonding is strong due to the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the positive nuclei and the pairs of shared electrons.
* Ionic bond: Ionic bonding is the **transfer** of electrons between atoms to achieve the stable electronic configuration of a noble gas. An atom becomes an ion when it loses or gains electrons and ionic bonds are strong because there are strong electrostatic forces between the oppositely charged ions.
