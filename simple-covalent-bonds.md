# Simple Covalent Bonds

### **Simple covalent bonds:** <a href="#_tinhlzbxdc17" id="_tinhlzbxdc17"></a>

_(\*Technically not tested in T2-CT)_

Structure and bonding: Oxygen has a simple covalent structure, with weak Van der Waals’ forces between the oxygen molecules.

Applications:

* Low MP and BP: Thus, a small amount of (heat) energy is required to overcome these weak Van der Waals’ forces between the oxygen molecules, resulting in _oxygen_ having a low melting and boiling point.
