# Dipole-dipole Bonds

### **Dipole-dipole bonds:** <a href="#_lfoivuqcmsr6" id="_lfoivuqcmsr6"></a>

Electronegativity:

* Electronegativity is the measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons to itself
* Electronegativity of an atom decreases as the distance from the most electronegative atom, Fluorine (F), increases

Bond polarity:

* When an atom in a molecule is more electronegative, it attracts the bonding electron pair more
* In the case of hydrogen, chlorine is more electronegative compared to hydrogen and thus will attract its bonding electron pair more
* This will result in a greater electron density around the more electronegative atom, and is thus given a partial negative charge, **δ-**
* The other atom will be then be given a partial positive charge, **δ+**
* This is called polarisation of the covalent bond

Dipoles:

* The centres of positive charge and negative charge do not coincide. This charge separation is called a dipole.
* Such bonds between atoms with differing electronegativity are polar
* The larger the difference between the electronegativities, the more polar is the covalent bond

Dipole moments:

* Dipole moments occur when there is a separation of charge. This means that the dipole moments can occur between two ions in an ionic bond or between atoms in a covalent bond. It arises from differences in electronegativity =, where a large difference in electronegativity would result in a large dipole moment. Thus, the dipole moment is the measurement of the polarity of the molecule.
* Arrows are commonly used to indicate a dipole. The arrow lies parallel to the bond and points towards the atom with the partial negative charge. ​![](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FMAwObOmuQ7e4SqVU0PO3%2Fuploads%2F98tAxqYMZXsCkqV7jjC1%2F2?alt=media)​

Molecule Polarity:

* Molecules with polar bonds are not always polar (CO2, BF3, CCl4)
* The polarity of a molecule depends on the polar that it contains, and the shape of the molecule, which determines if the dipoles will be cancelled out
* The molecules are polar if the dipoles do not cancel out. The molecules are nonpolar if the dipoles cancel each other out
* Polar molecules have a net dipole moment, nonpolar molecules do not have a net dipole moment
* Molecules with high electronegativity are **N, O and F** (and also Cl, Br, I)
