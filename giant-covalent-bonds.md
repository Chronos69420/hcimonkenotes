# Giant Covalent Bonds

### **Giant covalent bonds:** <a href="#_n6ffjaz37ax9" id="_n6ffjaz37ax9"></a>

* Graphite: _Graphite_ has a giant covalent structure. Each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three other _carbon_ atoms to form hexagonal layers, which are held together by weak Van der Waals’ forces. Each carbon atom contributes one electron to be delocalised across one entire planar sheet.
  * Applications:
    * High MP and BP: Thus, a large amount of (heat) energy is required to overcome the weak Van der Waals forces and break the strong covalent bonds between the _carbon_ atoms, resulting in _graphite_ having a high melting and boiling point
    * Ability to conduct electricity: During covalent bonding, _carbon_ atoms that make up graphite lose one electron to form delocalised electrons that can move freely between the layers of _graphite_ and these electrons can act as mobile charge carriers, resulting in _graphite_ being able to conduct electricity.
    * Very soft: As the Van der Waals’ forces between the sheets are very weak, little force is required to overcome it, resulting in the sheets being able to slide over one another.
* Diamond (Silicon dioxide is very similar): _Diamond_ consists of _carbon_ atoms held together in a giant covalent structure by strong covalent bonds. Each _carbon_ atom is covalently bonded to four _carbon_ atoms (each _Silicon_ atom is covalently bonded to four other _oxygen_ atoms) in a tetrahedral network.
  * Applications:
    * High MP and BP: Thus, a large amount of (heat) energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds to melt _diamond_, resulting in _diamond_ having a high melting point and boiling point.
    * Inability to conduct electricity: Thus, the (valence) electrons are all held in covalent bonds / are all used to form covalent bonds, and thus there are no mobile electrons/ions to act as mobile charge carriers, resulting in _diamond_ being unable to conduct electricity.
    * Very hard: Thus, it is hard to break the structure as the covalent bonds are very strong.
