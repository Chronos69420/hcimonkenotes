# Electronic Configuration

### **Electronic configuration:** <a href="#_2ifggifo4ehp" id="_2ifggifo4ehp"></a>

Pauli exclusion principle:

* An orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, and these electrons must have opposite spin
* Electrons are spinning about their own axis. This creates an electric field, which if not countered makes the atom unstable. To ensure the stability of the orbital, electrons are always paired according to opposite spins.

Hundâ€™s rule:

* Orbitals in a subshell must be occupied singly and with parallel spins before they can be occupied in pairs

Formation of ions:

* Atoms are electrically neutral as they have equal numbers of protons and electrons. An electron becomes an ion if it loses or gains electrons.
* Ions are formed when there are differing amounts of protons and electrons, causing them to carry a charge
* This charge can be positive or negative
* If there are more protons than electrons, the ion is a cation and will carry a positive charge
* If there are more electrons than protons, the ion is an anion and will carry a negative charge
* Note that while forming cations, the electrons are lost from the shell with the highest principal quantum number.
* Anions are formed by adding electrons to the vacant orbital of the lowest energy
