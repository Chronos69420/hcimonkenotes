# Giant Ionic Bonds

### **Giant ionic bonds:** <a href="#_5kmm2fusd1kl" id="_5kmm2fusd1kl"></a>

Structure and bonding:

* _Magnesium oxide_ exists as Mg2+ and O2- ions held together in a giant ionic lattice structure with strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions.

Applications:

* High MP and BP: Thus, a large amount of (heat) energy is required to overcome the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged mg2+ and o2- ions (need to specify) and break the strong ionic bonds, resulting in _magnesium oxide_ having a high melting and boiling point.
* Inability to conduct electricity in the solid state: Thus, in the solid state, the ions are held in fixed positions in the giant ionic lattice and the immobility of the ions prevents them from acting as mobile charge carriers, hence it cannot conduct electricity in the solid state.
* Ability to conduct electricity in the liquid or aqueous state: Thus, in the liquid and aqueous states, the lattice structure is broken, allowing the ions to move out of their fixed lattice positions. Hence, they can act as mobile charge carriers, which allows _magnesium oxide_ to conduct electricity in the liquid and aqueous states.
* Hard and brittle: Thus when a large mechanical force is applied, the layers of ions are shifted in a way such that ions of the same charge are now next to each other. The repulsive forces between ions of the same charge causes it to shatter. (When it breaks, it tends to do so along smooth planes because of the regular arrangement of the ions.)
