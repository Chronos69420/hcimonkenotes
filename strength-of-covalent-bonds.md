# Strength of Covalent Bonds

### **Strength of covalent bonds:** <a href="#_mupybjcq2cb1" id="_mupybjcq2cb1"></a>

Bond order:

* Bond order is the number of covalent bonds between a pair of atoms and indicates the stability of a bond. Bond order and bond length indicate the type and strength of covalent bonds between atoms. Triple bonds are stronger than double bonds which are stronger than single bonds.

Bond lengths:

* Distances between centres of bonded atoms are called bond lengths.
* As bond order increases, bond lengths decrease (For same elements)

Bond energy:

* Bond energy is the energy needed to break one mole of bonds to give separated atoms in the gaseous state.
* The higher the bond energy, the stronger the bond.

Factors affecting bond energy:

* Bond strength increases as bond order (number of bonds) increases
* Bond strength increases as bond length decreases (orbital overlap increases)
* Bond strength increases as differences in electronegativity increases
