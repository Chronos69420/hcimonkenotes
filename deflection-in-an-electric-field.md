# Deflection in an Electric Field

### **Deflection in an electric field:** <a href="#_pui3yfafgha9" id="_pui3yfafgha9"></a>

Deflection:

* Protons are deflected toward the negative potential
* Electrons are deflected towards the positive potential
* Neutrons are not deflected at all (Neutral charge)
* The path of deflection is in a curve

Magnitude:

* Greater deflection when mass to charge ratio is closer to 0
* When mass decreases, deflection increases
* When the charge increases, deflection increases
