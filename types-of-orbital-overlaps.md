# Types of Orbital Overlaps

### **Types of orbital overlaps:** <a href="#_kztiicwoxym3" id="_kztiicwoxym3"></a>

Head-on overlap (**σ** bond)

* The head-on overlap of atomic orbitals forms **σ (sigma)** bonds
* Due to the ways the orbital overlaps, the overlap is not orientation specified and the two atoms involved in forming the covalent bond can be rotated along the internuclear axis
* All single bonds in molecules are **σ (sigma)** bonds
* There can only be one **σ (sigma)** bond

Side-on overlap (**π** bonds):

* The **π** bond is a result of a side-on overlap of p orbitals. Electron density lies above and below the internuclear axis
* Before a **π** bond is formed, a **σ** bond must be present
