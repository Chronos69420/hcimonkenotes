# Energy Levels

### **Energy levels:** <a href="#_n82c8wi3egr5" id="_n82c8wi3egr5"></a>

Principal quantum number:

* n = 1 -> 1s
* n = 2 -> 2s, 2p
* n = 3 -> 3s, 3p, 3d (3d not tested)
* n = 4 -> 4s

Order of filling up magnitude (Aufbau principle):

* 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s
* ![](.gitbook/assets/1)
* When writing **spdf** notation, arrange subshells according to the principal quantum number before energy level. For example, even though 4s is filled up first, 3d is written first.
