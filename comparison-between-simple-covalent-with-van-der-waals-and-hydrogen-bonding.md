# Comparison between Simple Covalent with Van der Waals and Hydrogen Bonding:

### **Comparison between simple covalent with Van der Waals and Hydrogen bonding:** <a href="#_ykig8pbxnu0r" id="_ykig8pbxnu0r"></a>

_(\*Technically not tested in T2-CT)_

Higher boiling point: Both _ammonia_ and _carbon dioxide_ have simple covalent structures. Molecules of _ammonia_ are held together by strong hydrogen bonds, while molecules of _carbon dioxide_ are held together by weak Van der Waals’ forces of attraction. Since hydrogen bonds are stronger than Van der Waals’ forces, a larger amount of (heat) energy is required to break the hydrogen bonds between the _ammonia_ molecules than to overcome the weak Van der Waals’ forces between the _carbon dioxide_ molecules. Thus _ammonia_ has a higher melting/boiling point than _carbon dioxide_.
