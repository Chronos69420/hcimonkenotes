# Metallic Bonds

### **Metallic bonds:** <a href="#_e1ncpahtp4jk" id="_e1ncpahtp4jk"></a>

Structure and bonding: _Tin_ has a giant metallic structure, which consists of metal/_tin_ cations held together in a giant metallic lattice, in a sea of delocalised electrons, with strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the metal/_tin_ cations and the sea of delocalised electrons.

Applications:

* High MP and BP: Thus, a large amount of (heat) energy is required to overcome the strong electrostatic forces of attraction between the metal cations and the sea of delocalised electrons to melt _tin_, resulting in a high melting and boiling point.
* Ability to conduct electricity: Thus, the sea of delocalised electrons in tin are mobile and thus can act as mobile charge carriers, hence allowing _tin_ to conduct electricity
* Malleable and ductile: Thus when a force is applied to the metal, the sea of delocalised electrons allows the layers of metal cations will slide over each other without disrupting the non-directional metallic bonds, as the delocalised electrons can adjust their position to maintain the electrostatic attraction.
